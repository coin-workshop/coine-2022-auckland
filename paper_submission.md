## Paper Submission

### Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page. 

We solicit three types of papers:
- Full research papers (16 pages)
- Short research papers (10 pages) – These 'early-innovation' papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
- Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2022 (see [https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/](https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)), focussing on the COINE topics

The page lengths mentioned above include figures and references. All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format.

For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2022)

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work.

### Proceedings

Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2022 registrants in electronic form.

As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE will publish post-proceedings in Springer's LNCS series. Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
